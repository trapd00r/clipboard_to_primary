=head1 NAME

clipboard_to_primary - sync XA_CLIPBOARD to XA_SELECTION X11 buffers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  clipboard_to_primary [OPTIONS]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I rarely use any gui application, the exception being firefox with
tridactyl. For some reason you can't paste from the PRIMARY buffer in
firefox/tridactyl without using the mouse (and at times that doesn't
work either). This solves this issue by syncing the CLIPBOARD buffer
with the content of the PRIMARY selection so you can use Shift+Insert to
paste in gui applications as well.

The clipboard buffer to use is **hardcoded** in the gtk source:

None!
